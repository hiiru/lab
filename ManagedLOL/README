ManagedLOL
ManagedLOL is a small League of Legends tool still in it's alpha state.
It provides a Creep Timer overlay and a Item build editor.

The Creep Timer is a simple borderless windows which stays on top of everything, it has an icon for each creep spawn which can be started by left clicking. A running timer can be restarted by doubleclicking it or reseted by right clicking.
Also the whole window can be collapsed.

The item build editor reads all the champions from the LOL directory, then provides you the possibillity to choose and save your item build.


It works as it is, however the UI still requires some work and not all my intended features are available.


Note: I created this tool mainly to learn WPF.
