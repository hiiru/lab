AS24SPI is a proof of concept hybrid spider for autoscout24.ch, which demostrates how Awesomium could be used as an automated spidering engine.

All that this tool does, is requesting the default page, selecting a single brand, starting a search, parsing the list and printing the list.
It also renders two screenshots of the pages it spiders, so that it's possible to see what would be visible in a browser.



It's main advantage is, that it's use the complete chrome engine, which means all the scripts and embeded objects can be used.
In Theory it is possible to track and inject mouse events, so a user could be emulated, which makes it harder to detect the spider.

I guess that with Awesomium it could also be possible to create a more advanced spider debuging suite, 
which has a gui and directly displays the actions taken, maybe even creating some sort of spidering IDE.
However since I currently have no use of spidered information, so I won't continue this project.



This code requires that Awesomium 1.6 is installed (not included).
Also I'm using HtmlAgilityPack (http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) to parse the HTML code, which is included in the libs folder.
