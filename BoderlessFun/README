BorderlessFun
This small tool can remove the window border and resize the same window to fullscreen.
It is intended for games which doesn't provide a windowed fullscreen mode.

NOTE: This is still a prototype and not intended for daily use.

The tool works, however is not polished.
Hotkeys: 
CTRL-WIN-X -> Make active window borderless.
CTRL-WIN-Y -> Restore border to default.

GUI Functions:
Resize: resizes the window to fullscreen and remove border.
Don't Resize: only remove border.
Display: Screen on wich the window will be resized, if resize is enabled.
AutoBorderless: remove border, if resize is enabled also resize, as soon as a matching process is started.
Borderless: remove border, if resize is enabled also resize.


Missing Features:
MAJOR: Storage of previos window styles and position/size for restore (for allowing safe reset of original styles)
MAJOR: Persistant storage of "auto borderless" processes.
MINOR: Auto-Reload of Process list on changes (if Borderless window has focus)


Tested with:
L.A. Noire (which was also the reason why I wrote this tool, the missing windowed fullscreen was anoying...)
Lucid
and more (don't remember all of them).
